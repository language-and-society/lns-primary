# Movies, Language, and Women

Part of the Monsoon '20 course Language and Society. This project aims to find the differences in speech patterns between men and women in Bollywood. We have created a computational model to determine the lack of equality between men and women in Bollywood and how parallels can be drawn from that to the current situation in society. A lot of work done in this model is based on the works of Deborah Tannen and Lakoff.

We analysed 4 Bollywood movies which passed the _Bechdel Test_ and made observations and analyses. The movies are:
- Pink
- Dangal
- Queen
- Veere Di Wedding

A lot of interesting observations on society and language were made. Some major ones are:

1. English: Men speak more English than women in Bollywood movies.
2. Pronouns: Women use more pronouns that imply respect than men.
