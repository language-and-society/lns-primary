## Survey Analysis
### Robin Lakoff - Still Relevant?
We made a google form (credits: Prajneya) and had it filled by undergraduate students of age 18-20. The form had multiple questions which we made based on the ideas of Lakoff. Te deatailed statistics are explained in Joint Team Report, and all the visuals (done by me) are attached aswell.

## Talking from 9-5
### Women and Men at Work - Deborah Tannen
Deborah Tannen explains how many a times, conversations are like rituals. Much like other rituals, we do them not at their face value. For example, consider how we say, "Hey! How are you?" as a greeting. It is not meant literally; it does not mean that we want the listener to hand their entire detailed medical report! Its merely meant as a greeting. In the philippines, they say, "where are you going?". This may seem odd as a greeting, but only due to cultural differences.

So, how does this tie into a Gender Based Study? Quite like how cultural differences are able to make things uncomfortable for a person who doesn't know their way around, gender differences have been known to cause much issues in the workplace.

Tannen goes into great detail about all of this and more in her book, "Talking from 9-5: Women and Men at Work", which I chose to read. Many of the differences in the styles of conversation rituals stem form the basic social fact: Men are competetive and Women are cooperative.

Before giving examples, I have to mention that I read the entire book, and quite a few chapters focus purely on sociological differences, one was based on just sex and the other on the ways of dressing, and another one on personality traits. For a dive in the socio-linguistics aspect, I do not think they are helpful. Following are only some examples I cherrypicked, which cover all the important aspects.

So, lets get a clearer picture here. Conversational Rituals among men are: joking, teasing, banter and playful put downs. In contrast, for women, they are: appearance of eqality, avoiding down-playing other's authority, consideration of implications of the interaction.

1. Wage Gap: Lets consider the case of negotiating your salary. There is a superior and a subordinate. Considering the different combinations of M and F, we get:

1: highest raise - 4: lowest raise
| sub/super-> | F | M |
| - | - | - |
| F | 3 | 4 |
| M | 2 | 1 |

It is clear that men and women in themselves are comfortable with each other in the conversational rituals. So, the pairs should come at the top. But, how MM is 1 and FF is 3. Why? Its because men are assertive. They speak a lot of imperative sentences, which is a way of showing their power. For women, they are self consious about themselves. Its a battle of confience. Thus, they end up setting a low bar for themselves. Both of these reasons directly draw from the rituals. For the case of male superior and women subordinate, we see the lowest raise. This is because the former perceive the latter as weaker and unconfident and too polite.

2. Getting a Job: Another case is that of male boss under whom is a female interviewer, who has to pick between two candidates: M and F. Both were equally qualified, but the change of one single pronoun changes everything: WE vs I. The M candidate used WE, and talked as if he was already in the company, ready to take decisions. The F interviewer absolutely hated the arrogance of this guy. On the other hand, the F candidate used I. She talked how she, as 'I', could contribute to the firm. The F interviewer liked her. Interestingly, the male boss thought the complete opposite. He like the M because of the exact same reasons why the F interviewer rejected him! It is evident that we need to be more aware of these differences, to make better decisions ...

3. Getting fired ... or not! There was a F engineer in a team of 4 other Ms. She would not say much even when she disagreed, so as to not make enemies. But once she broke character. She gave a detailed and passionate description about one particular task, and contradicted one of the M. It was clear to her that she stepped over a line, and almost sat down in sadness of her getting fired. But, the M acutally responded by saying: "That was a great rebuttal. I’m really impressed. Let’s go out for a beer after work and hash out our approaches to this problem." 


It is clear from the above samples that men and women have completely different approaches to the same task. Both use different languages to convey the same thing, but often to different results. 

Infact, there are plenty researches out there, which prove that the teachings for children in their childhood affect their way of talking as the grow up. Infact for women, studies also claim that their polite way of speaking is similar to a "powerless" person's way of speaking. This is very well explained by the above idea, since girls are taught to be polite, while its okay for boys to be a bit rude.
