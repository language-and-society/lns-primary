INT. STADIUM - CONTINUOUS
Mahavir Singh enters the stadium. The coach is about to pose
with Geeta for the press. Just then Geeta sees Mahavir Singh
enter. She runs towards him, leaving the coach fuming.
COACH

Aray Geeta...aa jao,aa jao...media
wait kar raha hai bhai.come. Aa jao
sab khinch lo......come come come.
As Mahavir Singh looks at her with tears in her eyes and pride
on his face, Geeta can't stop crying and smiling.
Babita and Omkar join in. Geeta takes out her medal and puts
it around Mahavir Singh's neck. Mahavir Singh puts it back
around her neck, holds her by her shoulders and looks at her
with great pride.
