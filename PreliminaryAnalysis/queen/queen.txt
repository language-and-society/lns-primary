Camera pulls back, rani has wet mehandi on her hands. There
is a mehandi function going on. People are playing dholak and
dancing. Its all in slow motion from her POV like a dream for
her. Shes excitedly watching. There are people moving in and
out of frame.
As we stay on her face we see many thoughts running through
her eyes. Her eyes are watching many things at the same time.
(V.O.)
(a happy little chuckle) Agle teen
din main sabse important hoon. Sab
aa gaye meri shaadi pe, love cum
arranged marriage, america se
chacha, karnaal se kapoor uncle,
kal   Anu bhi aa rahi hai, meri
favourite cousin hai woh... sab

Someone comes and kisses her head from behind and runs away.
The girl sees who kisses her.
(V.O.) (CONT'D)
Mummy sabse khush, poori zindagi
bita di mujhe kisi aur ke ghar ke
liye tayaar karne mein. Best bahu
banegi meri beti, apne pati ko
khush rakhegi sabse zyada, baal tak

saas se pooch ke shaadi ke baad jo

Man walks into frame from behind rani, camera shifts focus on
to him (rani doesnt look at him) with bottles of beer. Hands
it to a young boy.
DAD
Oye saari mat peena, raat ke liye

(V.O.)
Papa ne to Apni mithai ki dukaan
aise sajai hai maano uski shaadi

An 8 year boy chasing two girls runs into frame he is hitting
them with flowers. He is running in between people dancing.
He enters picks up more flowers for ammo and runs out of
frame.
(V.O.) (CONT'D)
Yeh mera bodyguard. Market tak

hain chintu ko saath le ke jaao.
uskey mind mein bhi voh salman khan

Camera pulls back further and two guys with lots of mithai
boxes walk in front of her (they look like helpers)
MITHAI SHOP GUY 1
Didi aaj toh chamak rahey ho
MITHAI SHOP GUY 2
Ab mithai ki dukaan pe hulchal kaun
machayega
As she smiles at them. The camera leaves her and follows
them. The camera comes to many old women rehearsing a step
for  the performance. A young girl is teaching them the moves.
One old lady has hair dye on her head, she is in the front.
GIRL
Aapse nahi hoga yeh wala step
DADI
Arey aise kaise nahee hoga, poti ki

From the terrace we hear a voice, camera pans up

Do din shaadi se pehle koi aata hai

On her face, day changes to night, lights come on and she is
glowing. Someone comes, holds her hands and drags her to the
floor. She leaves her thoughts behind, joins them and starts
dancing
Music picks up.

Chintu, waiting outside a restaurant in some part of Delhi.
You know he's been waiting for sometime, he looks bored, he’s
playing with a stone, aiming at a pole and looks at his watch
a couple of times.
Rani and Vijay at a cafe. Vijay is a nice looking guy in
corporate clothes. A full-sleeved blue shirt with sleeves
rolled   back and grey trousers. A blazer on the back of the
chair.  He’s looking uncomfortable as rani looks shattered at
him. Disbelief and heartbreak hitting her like waves.
VIJAY
ek minute ke liye thoda practical
socho
Rani looks away
VIJAY (CONT'D)
Main tumharey angle se hi soch raha

And she picks up her bag and walks out crying. He keeps
looking at her go
Rani comes out running from the cafe, Chintu sees her crying,
she keeps walking
CHINTU (approaching her, very
concerned)
Kya hua didi? didi ro kyun rahey

Chintu confused
He quickly runs back into the cafe. He is not sure if he
should confront Vijay or run after his sister, still runs
inside.
CHINTU (to Vijay) (CONT'D)
Dekh loonga!
And then runs behind his sister.
CHINTU (Following Rani) (CONT'D)

Rani comes and sits on the bed with her bag next to her. She
tries to remove some of her clothes but finds her
undergarments  on top so doesnt remove them. She pretends to
be        busy, she watches one guy - mikhaelo, drawing some strange
things on the wall, she tries to decipher. She looks around
at   the strange messy room (pov shots of the room in details)
We hear the oriental boy singing in japanese in the bathroom
The japanese guy - lee cooper, comes out of the bathroom
door, its the same door which mikhaelo was sketching on. Lee
cooper is wearing a t-shirt which is lit in the centre, the
other guy is amused to see him
MIKAELO
You go out like this?
LEE COOPER
Yes
MIKHAELO
The police will catch you and put
you in jail
Lee cooper makes a face and mikhaelo goes back to painting
amused.
Lee sees rani who does not make any eye contact, he goes to
his bed wears his shoes and pulls out a piece of paper from
underneath his pillow, he looks at the picture and kisses it
and smiles at it and says something in japanese to it as if
talking to an actual person. Mikhaelo notices him talking,
Lee finishes his dialogue with the piece of paper and put it
back under his pillow and walks out. Mikhaelo keeps looking
at him in admiration
MIKHAELO (CONT'D)
Shut the door you fool
LEE COOPER
You shut it, do some work
Mikhaelo runs after him and the Lee quickly gets away.
Mikhaelo shuts the door, looks at rani who again avoids eye
contact and goes back to her bag and mikhaelo goes back to
his painting

inside.
mikhaelo is waiting outside holding himself. he’s trying to
appear normal but is obviously dying.
Rani is fully covered in the blanket, only her head is
sticking out. As Lee looks at her, the black guy walks in.
Rani notices that her bra, which she had removed in the
night,  is sticking out of the blanket. She's worried that the
boys will notice it, so slowly drags it in very nonchalantly
and expertly wears it under the blanket and then removes the
blanket.
RANI THANKS THE GUYS FOR BEING SO NICE THE NIGHT BEFORE AND
LETTING HER SLEEP IN THE ROOM.

at the cash counter. A strange noisy cycle van (ref: the beer

in dutch. She notices the 3 boys in it. They go away, she
keeps looking. She takes out her phone to check and sees a
few missed calls. Doesn’t know if she’s happy about that or
not. She pulls out a map and tries to figure it. There is a
bit of effort in trying to gauge it. A menu comes in front of
her.
RANI

Looks up and sees the same man from outside giving her the
menu

went, tim showing his empty guitar case and telling them how
he made so much money by singing “london thumakda”.
Suddenly Rani’s face freezes like shes seen a ghost. From her
point of view we see, its Vijay sitting on the pavement
outside the hostel. As he stands up, a strong breeze blows.
Music kicks in : nostalgic romantic track
Rani walks towards him. The boys are now one step behind.
Rani doesn’t know how to react. Vijay looks at the three
