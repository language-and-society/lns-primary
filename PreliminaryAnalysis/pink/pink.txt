He  is  clean  shaven,  wears  specs,  a  white  half
sleeves shirt and black trousers and formal shoes
and   is  attending  to  files  on  his  desk.  Signing
some. Reading some. Keeping some away.

An old couple. A young girl dead. The same young
girl  alive  on  his  work  table.  Surreal  painting
like.
He tries to find balance but trips. Tries to sit on

hai  hearing  ke  liye..Your’ll
must be ready.
They nod slowly. He waves a rickshaw down, sits in
it and leaves the court.
54A. INT. COURTROOM – DAY1 (1.5 MONTHS – MAY)
Saket Sessions Court
Everybody seems to be settled in the courtroom.
The typist, the bailiff (court clerk, court officer), the
lawyers, the under trials and the cops accompanying them in
the back waiting for their hearings, reporters, sketch
artists, court officials etc.
A certain awkwardness is only felt by Deepak and the girls
as they enter the courtroom of one of the Session Judges in
Saket court.
Two lawyers are looking at them.
LAWYER#3
Mehta ji ke aage kisey khada kar
rahin hain Bhai yeh ladkiyan? Yeh
toh hila hua hai suna hai!
LAWYER#4
Court ke andar Sehgal cheej alag
hai! Doosre ko hila de banda!
Inside however, Deepak feels uneasy as he is here after a
long time - having been in and around for years earlier and
the girls because they are here for the first time.
Minal's parents are extremely uneasy as if they are the
detainees.
A lost looking Deepak doesn't inspire any confidence either.
OMKAR
Aap - aapki... taiyyari achhi hai
na matlab...
He doesn't really know what to ask and Deepak doesn't really
know what to say.
Deepak is drawn to the floor. The cement is cracked and worn
off in places. He avoids it as he goes towards a table and
chair in the front but he keeps on getting distracted by the
floor - the cracks in the floor.
There is a sudden flurry and murmuring inside as well as in
the corridors of the small sessions court. "Prashant Sir",
"Mehta Ji"... These are the whispers you can hear and then
we  see the renowned Public Prosecutor PRASHANT MEHTA almost
storm in.
Once inside Prashant straight away lowers his specs from his
head onto his nose and begins to read the case file.
Then he senses something. Finds Deepak look at him almost
smiling. Prashant Mehta returns the smile. It is clear that
they have known each other before and been in such battles
before.
54 B. INT. COURTROOM. DAY1
 The Judge enters and the court rises and the case is
called.
COURT CLERK
Complaint Case no 541 / 2016. –
State Vs Minal Arora and others
JUDGE
Prosecution may proceed!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Your Honour - kuchh laws isliye
banaye gaye thhey kyunki society
auraton ko buri tarah se repress
kar   rahi thi - aur isliye unki
safety ke liye kayi naye kanoon
banaye gaye ya existing laws ko
mazboot kiya gaya! Khaaskar dowry ,
STALKING, Rape aur molestation ko
leke     jo laws thhey - unhey.
Unfortunately
pichhle kuchh saalon se ab kayi
mahilayein inhi laws ka faayda
uthakar shareef aur innocent logon
ko phansa rahin hain, unhey
blackmail karke extort karne ki
koshish   kar rahin hain. Iss case
mein   bhi yehi hua hai. Pehli
February ko ek rock show mein Minal
Arora ne Rajvir Singh aur uske
saathiyun ke saath dosti ki. Rajvir
aur  uske friends ne inn ladikyun ko
RS Resort mein dinner ke liye
invite kiya toh Minal Arora aur
uski saathioyun ne paise ke badle
mein inke saath sexual relations
establish karne ki offer di - iss
baat    se Rajvir ghabra gaya, usne
paise dene se inkaar kar diya toh
inhoney unke saath jhagda kiya -
usey rape case mein phansaane ki
dhamki di - Lekin jab Rajvir ne is
sab  ke baad bhi paise dene ko mana
kiya toh uspe hamla kar diya...
uski jaan lene ki koshish ki. The
attack was unprovoked and vicious.
Uske turant baad yeh ladki baaqi
saathiyun ke saath bhaag gayi.
The Judge looks at Minal for a moment. She feels
uncomfortable.
Minal looks at Deepak for assurance but he is looking at the
cracked floor.
PRASHANT MEHTA (CONT'D)
Ismein clearly Attempt to Extort,
Soliciting, Section 320 to be read
with 324 - ke under causing
grievous injury aur Section 307 ke
under attempt to murder ke charges
bantey hain! That is all your
honour!
JUDGE
Deepak Ji!
Deepak is a bit lost.
JUDGE (CONT'D)
Mr. Sehgal!
DEEPAK
Yes your honour!
Far from the lost character that we have seen, Deepak speaks
in calm measured tones with great poise as he has an
understanding of law and years of practise behind him but he
speaks softly, almost not audible to the people at back.
JUDGE
Opening arguement!
DEEPAK
Sir let me make it clear - Police
ke paas koi case nahi hai!
               JUDGE
Deepakji aap zara zor se bolengey..
DEEPAK
Sir let me make it clear - Police
ke paas koi case nahi hai!
It is a case of vindictive
litigation - cases actually yeh
bantey   hain - Section 354 -
Outraging the modesty of a woman -
Aisa Rajvir Singh ne mere client
Minal Arora ke saath Surajkund ke
RS resort mein kiya. Lekin police
ne Rajvir Singh ke influence mein
aakar, mere client Minal Arora ki
complaint ko ignore kar ke Rajvir
Singh   ki complaint ke basis pe ek
chargesheet darj kar diya. He..
Deepak feels parched. He hasn't spoken this much and for
this long in recent times. He looks around nervously and
then gulps down a whole glass of water.
This makes the girls even more nervous.
DEEPAK (CONT'D)
(looks at his notes)
Doosra charge hai Section 503 to be
read with 506 - criminal
intimidation - yeh ladke constantly
uss   ghatna ke baad mere client aur
unke doston ko dhamka ayr dara
rahein thei...they were…
And then Deepak loses trail. Perhaps the cracks distract him
again. Everybody waits. Prashant gets upto speak when Deepak
speaks abruptly.
DEEPAK (CONT'D)
Aur uss crime ko chhupaney ke liye
inhoney do jurm aur kiye. Section
340     - wrongful confinement... Ankit
Malhotra aur Raunak Anand urf Dumpy
ne  apne do saathiyun ke saath mere
client ko ek gaadi mein confine
kiya   aur usey rape..er..molest
kiya...
Aur kuch?
JUDGE
DEEPAK
Sir?
JUDGE
Is that all?
DEEPAK
Yes Sir
JUDGE
Prashant Ji!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Sir sabse pehle main Investigating
Officer Sarla Premchand ko bulana
chahunga!
54C. INT. COURTROOM. DAY1
The Judge nods and waves at the IO. The Investigating
Officer takes the stand.
SARLA TAKES THE VOW
PRASHANT MEHTA (CONT'D)
Aapne final chargesheet kis basis
pe file ki officer?
SARLA PREMCHAND
Ladkon ki complaint mujhe bahut
pehle mil gayi thi lekin ek mahila
officer hone ke naatey... aur
chunki maamla jawan ladkiyun ka
tha... maine turant ladkiyun ke
khilaaf action lene ki jagah
detailed investigation ki. Isi
beech mujhe Delhi se ladkiyun ka
file kiya hua zero FIR bhi mila!
Main mauke pe gayi jaanch ke
liye... phir main hospital
gayi jahan Rajvir Singh ilaaj ke
liye gaye thhey aur daktaron se
baat ki - mobile ke record check
kiye jiske hisaab se ladkiyan
ghatna ke waqt RS Resort mein
maujood thein. Ladkyun ki FIR mein
koi dum nahi dikha mujhe!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Phir aapne immediately Minal Arora
ko arrest kyun nahi kiya?
SARLA PREMCHAND
Sir yeh faraar thi!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Bina iske confession ke aapko kaise
pata ki isine Rajvir ko buri tarah
se maara?
SARLA PREMCHAND
Complaint ke baad investigation
mein RS resort ke manager aur ek
waiter ne iske khilaaf gawahi di
Sir!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Jis botal se humla kiya gaya voh
bhi aapne baramad ki?
SARLA PREMCHAND
Ji!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Exhibit PW 1/1 hai Sir! Minal Arora
ke fingerprints bhi hain! Report
attached hai! That is all your
honour!
(he also shows a photograph of the
bottle as evidence)
Court clerk typing.
JUDGE
Deepak Ji! Cross lengey aap?
DEEPAK
No cross
Phir main ab immediately Doctor
Uday ko bulana chahunga jinki
report pe IO Sarla ji ne act kiya!
54D. INT. COURTROOM. DAY 1
We see the surgeon from the hospital who attended to Rajvir
on the stand now.
PRASHANT MEHTA (CONT'D)
Chot kis intensity se ki gayi thi?
SURGEON
Bottle nahi tootti toh - the blunt
force trauma would probably have
kiled Rajvir Singh. Kafi deep cut
tha  - bottle bahut force se maari
gayi thi! Agar kaanch ke kuchh
tukde kisi critical artery ko
pierce kar jaatey ya zara sa bhi
idhar udhar lag jaate toh -
PRASHANT MEHTA
(completing the sentence)
Rajvir ki jaan ja sakti thi!
SURGEON
(nodding)
We are trained for emergencies.
Ladka bach gaya samjhiye!
PRASHANT MEHTA
That will be all your honour!
The judge nods.
JUDGE
Deepak Ji! Cross?
DEEPAK
No your honour. Maybe I will call
him later.
PRASHANT MEHTA
Main aage apni baat prove karne ke
liye RS resort ke waiter Mukesh
Kumar ko bulana chahta hoon.
JUDGE
Aa ja bhai!
54E. INT. COURTROOM. DAY1
The reluctant waiter comes to the stand.
Inn ladkiyun ko aapne dekha hai
pehle?
Ji!
MUKESH WAITER
PRASHANT MEHTA
Yeh vohi ladki hai jisne Rajvir pe
hamla kiya tha!
MUKESH WAITER
Ji!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Kya hua uss raat court ko
batayengey zara?
MUKESH
Pehle yeh sab bahar aaram se
baithey thhey - hans hans ke baat
kar rahey thhey! Maine ladkiyun ke
haav bhaav kapde dekhke hi manager
sahab ko bol diya ki yeh koi couple
vouple nahi hain - nikal do - subah
hi jaayengi ab aisi ladkiyan lekin
manager sahab bole guest hain,
jaane     ko kaise bol saktey hain!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Kya pehna hua tha inhoney?
DEEPAK
Objection.
PRASHANT MEHTA
Ismein kya objection hai aapko?
Deepak is lost.
DEEPAK
(suddenly)
It is not relevant.
PRASHANT MEHTA
Relevance hai -
JUDGE
What is your point Mr. Mehta?
PRASHANT MEHTA
Yehi ki sabne inke kapde notice
kiye thhey kyunki generally Resort
mein iss tarah ki ladkiyan..
MINAL
Humney bilkul normal kapde pehney
thhey.
JUDGE
Don't speak out of turn.
MUKESH
Nahi jis tarah ke kapde pehne
thhey, mujhe turant Manager sahab
se kehna pada ki yeh ladkiyan theek
nahi hain!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Lekin khali kapdon se toh aap aisi
baatein guess nahi kar saktey na?
MUKESH
Nahi yeh kamrey mein kyun jaatin
phir ladkon ke saath - aap yeh
sochiye - aur wahan bhi inmein se
ek     ek ladki, ek ek ladke ko kisi na
kisi bahane se alag leke ja rahi
thi!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Pehle kaun gaya?
MUKESH WAITER
(points to Andrea)
Pehle voh ladki gayi!
ANDREA
Sir I was...
JUDGE
Mr. Sehgal please speak to your
clients about propriety or we will
have them removed.
ANDREA
(to Deepak)
Please stop them Sir. We told you
everything!
FALAK
(to Deepak)
He is lying!
Deepak gestures them to be quiet.
DEEPAK
(softly)
The court will give you the chance
to defend yourself. Please sit down
quietly now.
JUDGE
(dictating)
The waiter Mukesh Kumar said,"I saw
the girls leaving one by one with
the boys."
PRASHANT MEHTA
Phir kya hua?
MUKESH WAITER
Thodi der ke baad achanak chillam
chhilli hui - jab tak hum pahunchey
ladkiyan bhaag chukin thein -
(pointing to Rajvir)
Aur yeh sahab ka face poora khunam
khoon!
PRASHANT MEHTA
That is all your honour!
JUDGE
Deepak Ji!
DEEPAK
NO CROSS
The girls react in surprise.
ANDREA
Sir? Why are you not asking
Deepak raises his hand to silence her and lets the waiter go
unchallenged.
PRASHANT MEHTA
Ab main Manager Ramakant Vijay ko
bulana chahunga!
JUDGE
Aaiyye!
54F. INT. COURTROOM. DAY1
The manager takes the stand.
PRASHANT MEHTA
Court ko bataiyye - Aap jab apne
customers ko entertain kar rahey
thhey restaurant mein toh kya keh

MANAGER
(looks down)
Sir main kaise...
PRASHANT MEHTA
I understand aap hichak rahein hain

MINAL
That is a lie, maine -
JUDGE
You will get your chance...
MINAL
But Sir maine...
JUDGE
Deepak ji...
DEEPAK
(firmly but softly)
Minal Honourable judge sahab aapko
baithne ke liye keh rahein hain and
please be quiet.
JUDGE
(dictating)
The manager Ramakant Vijay heard
Minal talking to Rajvir about
obscene things... Aap cross
kareingey?
DEEPAK
NO CROSS
54G. INT. COURTROOM. DAY1
The girls react again. They are about to speak when they
are interrupted by the Judge.
JUDGE
Minal Arora... please take the
stand.
A surprised Minal enters the dock.
JUDGE (CONT'D)
Aappe bahut serious charges hain?
Aapko kuchh bolna hai!
MINAL
Sir yeh sab baatein wrong hain.
Shaam ko Rock Show mein Vishwa ne
sabke saath introduce karaaya toh
baad mein Rajvir ne humey dinner ke
liye invite kiya... humey boys safe
lagey aur humney socha we will have
dinner and then go... it will be
fun... Toh wahan resort ke
restaurant mein maine ek drink
piya...    phir this guy
(pointing at the waiter)
said ki resturant close ho raha
hai... but room service mein khaana
mil jaayega... toh Rajvir ne bahut
politely humko room mein dinner
karne     ke liye invite kiya... phir
yeh drink karne lagey, maine bhi ek
drink liya magar khaana hi nahi aa
raha tha... Andrea bahar chali gayi

baad Falak aur Vishwa bhi bahar aa
gaye... main bhi jaane hi wali thi
kyunki humney decide kiya tha lekin
mujhe isne akele dekha toh he

karne laga... maine ek do baar mana
bhi kiya but then he started
grabbing me aur mujhe wall ke
against   push kar diya toh saamne
bottle rakhi thi ... I didn't know
how  to stop him toh maine maar
diya!
JUDGE
(dictating)
Jaiyye abhie. Accused has pleaded
not guilty.
(looks at his watch, then
at his file)
Agle haftey unnatees tareekh okay

Deepak abruptly steps upto the IO in the stand.
DEEPAK (CONT'D)
Sarla ji complaint ke itney dinon
baad tak aapne Minal Arora ko
giraftar kyun nahi kiya?
SARLA PREMCHAND
Yeh farar thi! Mil nahi rahi thi!
Chhupi hogi shayad kahin!
DEEPAK
(poker faced)
Phir abhie arrest hone se pehle yeh
easily aapko ghar pe kaise mili?
Chhupte chhuptey bore ho gayin
shayad? Ki koi dhund nahi raha -
kya matlab hai chhupne ka - ghar aa
gayin taxi pakadke - aapko suddenly
aaram se ghar pe mil gayi!
SARLA PREMCHAND
(mumbling)
Humey voh -
She stops and doesn't answer.
DEEPAK
I can't hear anything! Prashant ji

Prashant signals her to speak.
SARLA PREMCHAND

You are lying!
SARLA PREMCHAND

DEEPAK
You are lying... you are lying...
SARLA PREMCHAND

DEEPAK
(adamant)
You are lying!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Investigating officer ko intimidate

unhe galat saabit karein toh better
hoga!
DEEPAK
Okay. That seems fair! Main apni
baat ko prove karoonga Sir! Sarla
ji   - Yeh aapki police diary ki copy

(showing the photocopy of
the register to her)
Yeh yahan aapne ghatna ki raat
police diary ki hui hai case ki -
Right? Yeh... yehi hai na... this
one...
Ji!
LADY OFFICER
DEEPAK
Lekin uss raat aap duty pe hi nahin
thin - aapke ek wedding function

hain... photographs bhi hain –
Exhibit   DW 1/1 has been submitted
Sir... ek pen drive hai... print
outs  bhi hain - aur yeh copies

SARLA only)
Yeh aap hain?
SARLA PREMCHAND
Ji ji!
DEEPAK
Nice sari Sarla Ji! Sab guests mein
best hai aapki sari!
He gets lost in those pictures.
MINAL
(almost pleading)
Sir!
DEEPAK
(looks at Minal, then
abruptly at the IO)
Phir bhi chowki mein report aapki
handwriting mein hai - alag ink
mein...  alag kalam se - kaise?
LADY OFFICER
(fumbles)
Main shaadi se laut aayi thi jaldi!
DEEPAK
Time bhi likha hai aapne - aap
Faridabad Sector 77 ke Marriage
Hall       se Surajkund Police Station
sirf dus minute mein aayin - Baees
kilometer ki yeh distance jo
normally bayaless minute mein tay
ki   jaati hai aapne itni jaldi cover
kar li? Chaliye maan lete hain raat
mein traffic nahi rehta - lekin
sirf dus minute mein aapne yeh
distance itni jaldi kaise cover kar
li?
Beat. She has no answer.
DEEPAK (CONT'D)
Let me guess. Aapne 132 kilometre
per hour ki speed mein gaadi start
ki aur usi speed mein Surajkund
police station ke aage rok di...
(to the judge)
Inko race track pe hona chahiye,
(to Sarla)
kahan aap police mein apna time
waste kar rahin hain...
Makes a gesture that she is wasting her time there. Poeple
laugh.
DEEPAK (CONT'D)
But your honour police kuchh bhi
kar sakti hai toh chalo maan letey
hain.
SARLA PREMCHAND
Sir badi ghatna thi toh main ekdum
goli ki speed se Gypsy chala ke
pahunchi!
People laugh a bit.
DEEPAK
Achha... phir itni badi ghatna -
jiske liye aapne goli ki speed se
Gypsy chalayi - uski diary aapne
yahan sirf do line mein kyun likhi
hai?
(reading)
"RS Resort mein Minal Arora ne
Rajvir ke sar pe jaan lene ke irade
se botal de maari. Bahut khoon
baha."
LADY OFFICER
Do line mein ho gaya na ji matter
clear!
Laughter.
DEEPAK
Nahi aise kaise clear ho gaya Sarla
Premchand ji? Minal ka poora naam
likhne   ki zarurat samjhi aapne -
lekin Rajvir ka surname nahi likha
hai aapne - yeh toh chaliye hum
achhe log hain jo hum maan gaye ki
yehi Rajvir Singh voh Rajvir hain!
LADY OFFICER
Yehi case tha, yehi diary hui aur -
DEEPAK
(reading)
"Jis waqt Sushil Vats auto mein
baithey, mobile tha - jab voh
uttrey, unhoney apni jebein
tatolin, mobile nahi tha - unhoney
yaad kiya ki kab unhoney aakhiri
baar apne Zing 3c... Phir 3C kaatke
3G likha hai -
(looks up at her)
Fursat aur aapki dedication dekhne
wali hai Sarla Ji...
(reads again)
Zing 3G mobile ko dekha tha." Iske
baad bhi dus linein likhi hain
jabki mobile auto mein reh gaya hai
yeh ab tak teesri class ka bacha
bhi samajh sakta hai! Rickshaw mein
mobile khone ki diary aapne aadhe
page mein karvayi hai - lekin itni
badi ghatna ki diary ke liye sirf
do line kyun - yahan tak ki so
called victim Rajvir Singh ka
surname  bhi nahi likha aapne - I
will  tell you why - jagah nahi
bachi thi page pe - Aapne backdate
mein jaake yeh diary ki hai! Your
honour yeh iss poori police diary
mein akeli do line ki entry hai
kyunki iss page pe bas itni hi
jagah bachi thi back date mein
entry   ke liye - uske alaava aur koi
reason nahi hai! Inn donon baaton
se prove hota hai ki yeh incident
report karna... was just an
afterthought after Minal Arora
decided to file a complaint against
Rajvir Singh and others.
PRASHANT MEHTA
Yeh do line wali baat - rickshaw  -
jebein tatoli - surname nahi likha
- yeh sab conjectures hain your
honour - policewale haad maans ke
insaan hain, koi robot nahi ki
measurement ke hisaab se sab
cheezein   likhein - kabhie waqt raha
detail mein likha - kabhie laga
urgency hai - phataphat
investigation    ke liye nikle - yeh
theatrics  hain your honour - kanoon
jaanne walon ko inn baaton pe dhyan
nahi dena chhaiye - I would like to
further examine some of the
accused...

All overlapping each other until Andrea finishes.
ANDREA
This is a lie! I do nothing of that

You need not answer that!
ANDREA

DEEPAK
Megha, Clouds...mountains,
beautiful, Music and football!!!
JUDGE
How Is this relevant Deepak Ji?
DEEPAK
I thought it is. Mukesh Kumar se
nahi poochha ki voh Rajasthan se
hain...Sarla Premchandji se nahi
poochha      ki voh Haryana se kyon hain
- Doctor se nahi poocha - Ramakant
Vijay se nahi poocha so – I thought
ki Prashant Ji Andrea se pooch rahe
hain so there may be some relevance
ANDREA
Sir I... I feel as a North Eastern
girl I am harassed more than the
average Indian girl on the street!
DEEPAK
So Andrea what was the reason ki
aap uss kamrey mein gayin?
ANDREA
Mujhe bathroom jaana tha - Rajvir
said the flush is not working so go
to the other room!
DEEPAK
Check kiya tha aapne?
ANDREA
Nahi but Rajveer ka room tha - he
said please go to the other room -
what could I have done?
DEEPAK
Aap Akele kyun nahi gayin?
ANDREA
Rajvir said locked hai. Dumpey open
it for her and Dumpy just followed
me!
DEEPAK
Why did you shut the door and not
him?
ANDREA
(shrugs)
Socha nahi clearly... I was in a
rush, Dumpy was switching the
lights on - It was just
instinctive...
DEEPAK
Fair enough. Fair enough. Phir aap
wahan ruk kyun gayin - kya kiya
aapney?
Sir!
ANDREA
DEEPAK
Answer me. The court wants to know.
ANDREA
First I used the toilet.
(a bit hassled)
Then when I came out of the toilet
he had switched the room lights
off. I was scared to step out but
then I heard him laughing in the
room – then voh mujhey touch karney
laga..then he pushed me and he
started touching my…he touched my…
DEEPAK
That’s all your honor
Andrea leaves the stand.
DEEPAK (CONT'D)
Prashant Ji it seems clear ki
Andrea us room mein kyun gayi aur
voh itni der tak kyun ruki etc etc!
But I do get your point. And your
point leads me to the making of a
Girls safety manual - Kisi bhi
ladki  ko kisi bhi ladke ke saath
kahin bhi akele nahi jaana chahiye!
Kisi resort mein ya kisi toilet use
karney ke liye toh bilkul nahi.
Kyunki aisa karney se wahan ke log
aisa assume kar letey hain ki vo
willingly wahan pe aayin hain aur
unhey ussey touch karne ka ya
chhooney ka license issue kar diya
gaya hai – Rule no.1
PRASHANT MEHTA
Let us not moralise (THE ISSUE) Mr.
Sehgal. Facts pe baat kartey hain.
Sir mein ab Raunak Anand urf Dumpy
ko bulana chahunga Sir!
60B. INT. COURTROOM. DAY3
Dumpy comes to the stand.
PRASHANT MEHTA (CONT'D)
Aap Andrea ke saath dossre kamre
mein gaye thhey?
DUMPY
Haan Sir gaya tha!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Lobby mein jo CCTV camera laga hai
uske hisaab se kafi der tak andar
thhey aap?
DUMPY
Ji tha!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Kya kar rahey thhey itni der?
DUMPY
Ab main openly kya bolun Sir - aap
guess kar lijiye!
ANDREA
He is lying!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Aap chup rahiye - aapke paas mauka
tha apni baat kehne ka -
Kya kar rahey thhey itni der tak
aap donon wahan?
DUMPY
Sir she told me ki paise ki baat
Minal kar legi Rajvir se toh
main... main ghabra gaya... but she
kissed me and then... meri shirt...
but  I stopped her... maine samjhane
ki try ki...
PRASHANT MEHTA
Dumpy Anand... court yeh kyun maan
le ki aapne us waqt resist kiya...
after all you look like a healthy
young man, Andrea is a very pretty
girl so all this is a bit difficult
to believe!
DUMPY
Sir I have a girlfriend and...
health factor hai... Sir we are
from decent families... hum... it
was awkward...
DEEPAK
I Object.
PRASHANT MEHTA
(confused)
To what?
DEEPAK
To this awkward performance. He is
overacting
JUDGE
(smiling)
Can we get back to business please?
Deepak is just gesturing towards Dumpy that this is a liar
we have here.
FALAK
(abruptly)
Jhooth bol raha hai yeh Sir -
Jhooth bol raha hai - Poori shaam
yeh Andrea ke saath bahut awkwardly
flirt kar raha tha - Poor girl kept
ignoring him. Toh na toh yeh decent
hai,  na iski -
PRASHANT MEHTA
Sir ab main inhi ko - co-accused
Falak Ali ko bulana chahunga! I
think she has a lot to say aur
unhey apni baat kehne ka chance
milna chahiye.
JUDGE
You can go Dumpy. Falak Ali. Aap
aaiyye!
60C. INT. COURTROOM. DAY3
Falak takes the stand.
PRASHANT MEHTA
Apne ghar mein kamane wali sirf aap
hain?
Ji!
FALAK
PRASHANT MEHTA
Aapke bhai ke ilaaj vagairah mein
kafi kharcha hota hoga - he is a
special child - right?
FALAK
Ji!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Salary kitni hai aapki?
FALAK
Chalees hazaar!
PRASHANT MEHTA
In hand?
FALAK
Tees ke aas paas!
PRASHANT ADVANI
Loans vagerah hain!!!
FALAK
Ek personal loan hai aur ek home
improvement loan hai!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Paise ki bahut zarurat rehti hogi
phir!
FALAK
Haan magar -
PRASHANT MEHTA
Aur kisika support hai aapko -
FALAK
Matlab - main samjhi nahi...
PRASHANT MEHTA
(meaningfully, measuring
each word)
Nahi naturally aapko paise ki
zarurat rehti hai bas yeh poochhna
chah raha tha... aur kahin se aapko
koi finacial support nahi hai yeh
bata raha tha.
Falak reacts.
PRASHANT MEHTA (CONT'D)
Ab main yeh kyun poochh aur keh
raha hoon iske liye main Rajvir
Singh ko bulana chahunga!
The Judge makes a sign. Falak gets down.
60D. INT. COURTROOM. DAY3
 Rajvir walks towards the dock and stands.
PRASHANT MEHTA (CONT'D)
Uss din kya hua tha court ko batoh
na aiyye!
RAJVIR
Well we were at a rock show and -
DEEPAK
Objection!
PRASHANT ADVANI
(Surprised)
Ismein kya objection hai aapko?
DEEPAK
We all know Rajvir Singh ke aapki
intial schooling ek top
International School mein hui...
Uskey      baad aapko Engineering karne
ka mauka mila... par aapne voh na
pursue karke Economics karan chaha
pehley toh app yahin University
mein padey…par uskey baad aap Kings
College London gaye Economics
padney…mein samajh sakta hoon ki
aapke     liye kaafi mushkil hoga par
can you remove your hands out of
your pocket?
RAJVIR
Sure -
RAJVIR
Sir inhoney humey ek rock show mein
dekha. Phir purani dosti ke bahane
Vishwa se baat ki. Jabki Vishwa ki
inse koi khaas dosti nahi thi.
Khoob ghul milke hans hanske
baatein karney lagin!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Aapko tab shaque nahi hua inpe ki
bina jaan pehchan ke ke itna khulke
kaise baat kar rahin hain aapke
saath?
RAJVIR
Nahi pehle rock show mein utna
shaque nahi hua - laga thoda
friendly hain bas - Lekin resort
mein seedha yakeen ho gaya jab yeh
saaf hints dene lagin!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Kya hints?
RAJVIR
Ki chalo alag alag chaltey hain -
you can give us something and we
can have a good time!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Lekin phir bhi clearly kuchh nahi
kaha?
RAJVIR
Nahi... lekin ek baar inhoney thodi
pi li toh phir room mein saaf saaf
baat ki inhoney!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Kya baat?
RAJVIR
Yehi ki paise ke badle mein hum
inke saath enjoy kar saktey hain!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Yeh kaise hua?
RAJVIR
Pehle mujhe shaque tab hua jab yeh
ladkiyan sabko alag alag le jaane
lagin!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Aur iss baat se aap ghabra gaye ki-
DEEPAK
Prashant ji - why call him to stand
- aap khud hi bol dijiye - uske
munh mein shabd daalne ki aapki
mehnat bach jaayegi!
JUDGE
Prashant ji - Please don't lead the
witness.
RAJVIR
Sir thoda bahut doubt hua lekin
phir isne mere liye ek drink
banaya... mujhe touch karney
lagi... maine bhi respond kiya…I
went with the flow... lekin phir
isne bola ki paise dene
padeingey... I was shocked - dar
gaya      main ki yeh toh call girls
hain   - maine kaha nahi nahi tum jao
mujhe kuchh nahi karna - toh isne
bolo karna hai nahi karna hai koi
problem nahi - lekin paise do -
nahi    toh main chillaungi ki tum log
humey rape karney ki try kar rahe
ho!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Lekin paise dene ke liye aap nahi
maaney?
RAJVIR
Nahi! It was awkward and I was a
bit tipsy - I was so
confused - meri samajh mein kuchh
nahi aa raha tha and she was drunk
aur chillaye ja rahi thi -
PRASHANT MEHTA
Phir?
RAJVIR
Beat.
Phir isney mujhe dhakka diya aur
iske haath mein jo bottle thi ussey
mujhpe attack kiya!
PRASHANT MEHTA
That will be all.
DEEPAK
I have a question!
DEEPAK (CONT'D)
Aapne kaha ki shuru mein inhoney
aapko kuchh hints diye - kya hints
diya inhoney?
RAJVEER
Bahut zyada frank ho rahin thin
yeh! Smile vmile de rahi thi -
touch kar rahi thi haath se baat
kartey waqt -
Deepak waits. Rajvir doesn't say anything more. Deepak looks
at the judge surprised. Then he realises Rajvir has
finished. These were the hints.
DEEPAK
Oh aapki baat khatam ho gayi... So
basically Rule no 2. Kisi bhi ladke
se   hans hans ke, touch kartey hue
baat mat kijiye nahi toh voh uske
hint samajh baithega hai. Aapki
hansi ko voh aapki haan aur aapke
natural human behaviour ko aapke
chaalu hone ka saboot maan sakta
hai!
JUDGE
(Looks at his watch)
Cross aap next time complete kar
lijiye Deepak ji!
DEEPAK
No that is all I wanted to ask your
honour.
JUDGE
Toh - pachees chalti hai aapko?
PRASHANT MEHTA
(looking at his diary)
Pachees ko meri Supreme Court mein
peshi hai aur...
JUDGE
Toh aap boliye...
PRASHANT MEHTA
Sataees your honour - is 27th okay
with you Mr-
DEEPAK
Ek hi case hai... ek hi client...
it is okay!
DISSOLVE TO:
61.EXT. DEER PARK - EVENING(ALREADY SHOT)
Deepak and Minal walking. Deepak has his handkerchief in his
hand. Two joggers cross them on their run.
JOGGER#1
(within their earshot)
Surjakund kaand wali thi na yeh?
Minal reacts. Deepak realises she has heard this. Minal
wears her hoodie and they continue to walk.
For some reason - perhaps in anger - or frustration with
himself - Deepak throws her hoodie back uncovering her face.
CUT TO:
62A. INT. COURT - DAY4 (27TH SEPT)
The Judge takes his seat. Deepak is already standing.
DEEPAK
Waiter ya manager ne jo dekha suna
uska ek context tha your honour...
voh aate jaate rahe... poori
cheezein theek se nahi dekhin
isliye  maine unhey cross examine
nahi kiya - exactly hua kya tha
uske liye main Minal Arora ko
bulana chahunga Sir!
The Judge waves Minal on.
DEEPAK (CONT'D)
Aap inn ladkon se kahan aur kin
circumastances mein milin?
MINAL
Hum shaam ko ek music event mein
miley! Main Vishwa ko jaanti thi!
School se! Usi ne humey baqi sab
ladkon se milaya.
DEEPAK
Okay!
(stressing)
Toh aap inmein se kisi ko pehle se
jaantin thin - school se - isliye
saath chali gayin! Kya tab inn
ladkun ne koi aisi vaisi baat ki
thi jissey aapko laga ho ki inke
saath nahi jaana chahiye?
MINAL
Nahi bilkul bhi nahi - I though we
were very safe! Vishwa I thought
was  a friend, Dumpy CUTE AUR FUNNY
LAGA  - Rajvir also looked decent
toh hum chale gaye!
Phir?
DEEPAK
MINAL
Phir show khatam ho gaya! We were
hungry. Humne inhey yeh bataya, bye
bola aur hum nikalney lagey! Lekin
inhoney kaha saath ke RS resort
mein booking hai hamari - Dinner
serve ho raha hoga wahan! Pehle
hamne kaha kabhie baad mein but
they insisted. They said it is
really good food... ek open
restaurant hai and we can have food
there  and then go. Falak ne kaha
nahi chhodo, phir kabhie but Andrea
and I thought it will be good fun.
Ek baar phir inhoney request kiya -
phir insist karne lagey toh we
thought chalo chale jaate hain-
Dinner karke nikal jaayeingey!
DEEPAK
Uske baad?
MINAL
Hum dinner ke liye chale gaye!
DEEPAK
Aap wahan smile kartin rahin -
extra friendly thein aap?
MINAL
I was normal.
DEEPAK
Khaana peena - normal hansi mazzak
- itne achhe hosts thhey aapke
Minal - phir aapne aisa kyun kiya -
botal kyun de maari inke sar pe?
MINAL
He grabbed me from the back aur
mujhe chhod nahi raha tha. I don't
know what came over me! I can not
explain. Ek ajeeb, gandi feeling
hoti    hai - jab koi aise touch karta
hai - aur yeh first time bhi nahi
tha - ever since he got drunk
mainey repeatedly isko bola mat
karo     - aise koi baar baar chhuvega
Sir toh - I lost it - I am sorry
isko itni lagi but I swear - if he
or anybody else does it again -
reflex se hi main aise hi dobara
maar dungi - kisko achha lagta hai
aise kisi ka zabardasti chhuna?
There is silence in the courtroom.
DEEPAK
Need I say more your honour?
JUDGE
Minal Arora says, 'Rajvir Singh
tried to outrage my modesty and I
did so to protect myself. Prashant
Ji! Cross!
Prashant is smiling.
PRASHANT MEHTA
The theatrics continue... Badi
achhi tarah se edit karkey ghatna
ki raat wali baatein batayin aapne!
Toh jo facts chhoot gaye hain voh
main court ke saamne laana chahunga
-  aapne kitne paise maangey?
DEEPAK
Objection!
JUDGE
Prashant Ji careful!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Sir mere liye yeh accept karna
mushkil hai ki koi ladki ek ladke
ko sirf thoda bahut jaanti hai...
doosra use CUTE AUR FUNNY  lagta
hai aur teesra usey decent lagta
hai sirf isliye unke saath unke
hotel room mein jaayegi! Kaunsi
ladki aise achanak ajnabiyun ke
saath kisi resort mein jaati hai?
MINAL
USS TIME MUJHEY THEEK LAGEY - islliye
mein gayi this - but Yes it was a
mistake. We shouldn't have gone.
PRASHANT MEHTA
It wasn't a mistake. It was a
calculated move.
MINAL
No!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Yes. Aapne khud kaha ladke aapko
safe lagey! Safe lage ka kya
matlab?
MINAL
Matlab laga nahi ki harmful hain!
PRASHANT ADVANI
Harmful nahin hain - matlab - aapne
socha ki yeh ladke aapko koi
nuksaan nahi pahunchayeingey ya
nahi pahunchaana chaheingey!
Ji!
MINAL
PRASHANT ADVANI
Seedhey type ke decent ladke?
MINAL
Haan magar -
PRASHANT MEHTA
Aapko yeh bhi laga ki yeh ladke
thodey rich hain - they might be
interested ya aapse dab jaayeingey
- lekin asal mein na voh interested
thhey na voh dabey aur isi vajah se
incident hua! Dinner ki request aur
insistence ki vajah se nahi gayin
aap   wahan!
MINAL
Nahi show mein friendship ho gayi
thi toh hum -
PRASHANT MEHTA
Friendship mein saalon lagtey hain!
MINAL
Ok jaan pehchaan ho gayi isliye -
PRASHANT MEHTA
Haan vohi toh keh raha tha ki aap
Rajvir aur baqi ladkon ka
background jaan gaye ki voh ameer-
MINAL
Uss waqt mujhe pata bhi nahi tha ki
yeh kitne rich aur kitne well
connected hain!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Toh chaliye maan letey hain aap
bina kisi aise vaise maqsad ke
dinner karney pahunch gaye -  phir
drink kyun karney lag gayin?
MINAL
Unhoney offer kiya toh humne ek ek
drink le liya -
PRASHANT MEHTA
Chaliye achha hai - kum se kum
ismein aapne claim nahi kiya ki
zabardasti ki gayi - ek photograph
hamney submit ki hai your honour...
For the record apna drink yeh khud
bana rahin thi! Luckily kisike
mobile pe iska proof hai!
MINAL
(thinks)
Nahi actually... chhota sa table
tha... bahut saari bottles thi
- Vishwa ne Andrea ka drink
banaya...bottle rakh di - toh
Rajvir           ne bottle maangi toh maine
bottle leke glass mein thoda pour
kar diya!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Your honour the point to be noted
here is KI INHONEY KHUD RAJVIR KE
LIYE EK DRINK BANAYA...Taiyyari
room ke andar jaate hi shuru ho
gayi thi!
MINAL
Sir bottle door thi toh -
PRASHANT MEHTA
Rajveer ko maarney se pehle kitni
pi rakhi thi aap logon ne?
MINAL
Maine ek drink li thi - Rajee had a
beer. Falak doesn't drink! She was
having nimbu paani or something.
PRASHANT MEHTA
Are you sure? Ek hi drink pi thi
aapne?
MINAL
Humney bahar ek drink pi thi - jab
andar room mein gaye toh ek aur
drink li...
PRASHANT MEHTA
Bahar aapne Rajvir ke saath ek
obscene conversation chhedi thi
jiske witness manager bhi thhey -
what was that about?
MINAL
I don't remember.
PRASHANT MEHTA
Then let me remind you - Usmein
sexual act ka description tha - jo
aap Rajvir ko de rahin thin!
Manager ne apne kaanon se suna!
Were you describing different acts
and how much you charge for it?
MINAL
(nervous)
Sir I remember... I ... I was...
was just telling him a joke... usne
ek joke sunaya tha toh maine bhi-
PRASHANT MEHTA
Joke? Kya joke tha?
JUDGE
Prashant Ji - what is this?
PRASHANT MEHTA
Let her tell the joke... Your
honour but yeh jhooth bol rahin
hain - I just want to call her
bluff...
MINAL
Main jhuth nahi bol rahi!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Toh sunaiyye - pareshaani kya
hai... agar description roughly
vaisa  hai jaisa manager ne suna toh
hum maan lengey!
Minal is quiet. She sees her parents sitting. They look
away. Falak gets up. Andrea holds her. She sits down. Minal
keeps quiet.
MINAL
I ... I can't say this!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Kyun? Bana nahi pa rahin hain joke?
MINAL
Kisi ko private mein joke sunana
aur publicly...
PRASHANT MEHTA
That is exactly my point your
honour. Jab ek ladki publicly aisa
joke tak nahi suna sakti toh
publicly maanegi kaise ki voh wahan
solicit kar rahi thi - Naturally
voh   yehi kahegi ki simple dinner
and drinks ke liye saath gayi thi -
Lekin court ko samajhaana chahiye
ki  voh unke saath gayi jo almost
uske liye strangers hain - So we
can not depend on her statement. We
have to depend on other witnesses
and the video evidence which we
want to play in front of the court!
We will prove ki inhoney paise
maange!
JUDGE
I will allow!
MINAL
Maine koi paise nahi liye na
maange!
DEEPAK
Your honour these are selective
visuals which tell a selective
story!
JUDGE
The court would still like to see
them.
The judge nods.
62B. INT. COURTROOM. DAY4
The court windows are covered with a black cloth and a
portable projector with a USB drive plays video footage from
the CCTV cameras in the lobby from that night.
The girls stepping out from the room and talking to each
other in the lobby.
Then Andrea leaving with Dumpy.
Vishwa and Falak walking away in the lobby.
The girls running together.
PRASHANT MEHTA (V.O.)
Bahar aapas mein rate ki baat ki
inhoney - ladkon ko andar lagne
laga    tha ki kuchh odd hai - yeh
andar aayi aur phir ek ek karke
Andrea aur Falak bahane ke saath ek
ek ladke ke saath bahar gayin.
Lekin Minal ne phir andar Rajvir se
paise maange - usne nahi diye toh
uske saath jhagda kiya aur jab
inhey apni galti ka ehsas hua toh
yeh bhaag khadin huin!
The video ends and the windows are uncovered.
FALAK
Hum bahar paise maangne ki baat
discuss nahi kar rahey thhey. I was
uncomfortable. I was saying chalo
yahan        se.
DEEPAK
Sit down!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Ajeeb hai – Falak ne kaha chalo
lekin chalne ki jagah yeh wapis
andar  aa gayin. Inki galti nahi
hoti  toh yeh bhaagti kyun? Inki
galti nahi hoti toh yeh police ko
bulaake complain kartin but koi
prostitute (OR aisi ladki) police
ko      kyun bulayegi? Manager aur
waiter ka bayan hai - Uske alaava
inke neighbours ki testimonies hain
ki jahan yeh rehtin hain wahan bhi
society ke logon ko inpe shaque tha
ki  yeh pesha karti hain!
MINAL
(going ballistic)
This is bullshit. Bakwaas hai poori
ki poori - jhooth bol rahein hain
yeh ladke aur aap bhi - inhoney hi
request kiya tha hamey aake ki
hamare saath dinner karo -  koi
paise nahi maange maine ya kisine -
Andrea sirf bathroom use karne ke
liye gayi thi - There was smoke in
the room because the boys were
smoking aur Andrea wapis laut ke
aayi  nahi thi - Falak isliye bahar
chali gayi thi room se and I
thought Vishwa bhi aise hi gaya but
I    am sure Rajvir ne usko ishara
karke jaane ko kaha hoga... and
then this bastard started touching
me again and again - maine isko ek
do baar warning di lekin isne mujhe
zabardasti pakda baar- itni baar
kaha     phir bhi isne touch kiya
isliye maine bottle de maari isko -
yeh ruk hi nahi raha tha!Dobara
karega dobara maaroogi saale ke sar
pe main!
JUDGE
I am warning you. We will have you
removed.
MINAL
(panting)
Arey lekin main -
DEEPAK
Quiet! Minal!
JUDGE
(angry, looks at Minal)
The court would want to hear all
the other witnesses against her.
(looks at Deepak and
Prashant)
2nd ko?
Prashant nods.
JUDGE (CONT'D)
Deepak Ji?
Deepak makes a gesture - FINE! WHATEVER!
He is upset!
Poeple start leaving. The court gets empty.
The three are left alone with Deepak who is still sitting.
MINAL
(breathing heavily)
Nahi liye... na maange humne
paise...
(further additions of minal…) – nahin maangey
meine paisey – sir – we didn’t

Gupta the girl's neighbour is in the stand. Prashant is
standing there.
GUPTA
Haan ladke aatey hain inke ghar pe
kabhie kabhie?
PRASHANT ADVANI
Late bhi aatin hain regularly?
GUPTA
Late kya - kabhie kabhie toh aatin
hi nahi hain - tabhie se shaque hai
hamey!
PRASHANT ADVANI
That will be all.
JUDGE
Cross?
Deepak gets up.
DEEPAK
Gupta ji raat ko jo ladke kabhie
kabhie inke ghar aatey hain kya voh
sirf dost ho saktey hain?
GUPTA
Ho saktey hain lekin nahi bhi to ho
saktey hain Sehgal sahab?
DEEPAK
Right - toh voh log andar kya
kartey hain - kabhie aapne inki
balcony mein chadh ke dekha?
GUPTA JI
Nahi Sehgal sahab main aise kaise
kisi ke ghar mein jhaank sakta h-
DEEPAK
That is so decent of you! Toh phir
aapne inko andar kabhie kisi ladke
se paise lete ya unke saath bed
mein nahi dekha hoga?
GUPTA JI
Nahi magar -
DEEPAK
Nahi mein magar ki gunjaish hi nahi
hai! That is all your honour. Mr.
Sinha and Mr. Gupta from our
society are just presuming things.
But they made an important point.
Late aatin hain. Rule no 3. Ghadi
ki sui se hamarey yahan character
decide hota hai. Raat ko (KOI
LADKI) akele ja rahi ho toh hamarey
yahan gaadiyan slow hone lagtin
hain, GAADIYON KE SHEESHEY UTARNEY
LAGTEY HAIN, lekin din ko yeh
mahaan idea kisi ko nahi soojhta.
But Prashant Ji ke tokne se pehle
let me just stop here and let us
stick to facts. In ladkiyun ke
landlord Kasturi Lal Ji ka written
statement submitted hai ki unhey
dhai   saal se inn ladkiyun se koi
shikayat nahi hai aur managing
commitee  ke zabrdasti pressurise
karney  ke bavajaood voh inko nahi
nikalna chahtey kyunki yeh ladkiyun
bilkul bekasoor hain.
JUDGE
(dictating)
Counsel has raised objection
towards the testimony of the
neighbours and found them to be
factually weak... Haan Prashant Ji!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Yeh ek FIR hai purana your honour -
humney submit kiya hai!
65B. INT. COURTROOM. DAY5
The judge looks at the paper.
PRASHANT MEHTA (CONT'D)
Hauz Khaas thaane mein hi register
kiya tha ladkiyun ne! Tab bhi kisi
innocent pe harrasment ka charge
lagaya tha jo paise leke wapis le
liya inhoney!
MINAL
His parents apologised isliye wapis
liya tha because we felt sad for
them!
JUDGE
You can only speak when you are
called to the stand.
PRASHANT MEHTA
It is a pattern with her your
honour. Paisa extort karney ke liye
harrassment ya molestation ke
charges    lagana Minal Arora ke liye
routine hai!I want to re- examine
her!
JUDGE
Aap aaiyye phir se!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Kya matter tha yeh aapke hisaab se?
MINAL
Sir voh ladka roz office se Andrea
ke aane pe uspe comment karta tha -
Uske mom dad ne request kiya tha ki
uska career kharab hoga ISLIYE CASE
WAPIS LIYA HUMNEY! KOI PAISE NAHI
LIYE!
Aapka apna ghar hai Dilli mein?
MINAL
Ji - Karol Bagh mein!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Wahan - Ma Baap rehtey hain - jagah
bhi kafi hai - phir inn ladkiyun ke
saath alag kyun rehtin thein aap?
MINAL
I am an independent working girl -
mere dance shows bahut late khatam
hotey hain aur mere parents jagey
rehtey thhe - main nahi chahti thi
mere profession ki vajah se mere
parents ko koi takleef ho -
PRASHANT MEHTA
Nahi takleef toh aapko yeh thi ki
aapko idea tha - aap asal mein jo
kaam kartin hain wahan nahi kar
saktin - aaj bhi laakhon
independent     - late night shift
karney      wali ladkiyan apne ghar mein
aaram se rehtin hain!
DEEPAK
Objection!
JUDGE
Overruled. This seems relevant!
Mehta ji-unneccessarily accused ke
character ko question mein nahin la
rahein hain!
DEEPAK
Exception!
JUDGE
Noted!
Deepak is distraught. It seems as if this is a losing cause.
DISSOLVE TO:
66. EXT. RAJVIR'S HOUSE  LAWNS - NIGHT
Everyone seems very pleased. Drinks. Little snacks.
The group wanders to Prashant who is standing and talkin
politics with Ranjit.
(to Ranjit)
Haan sahi hai - Bahut disappointing
record raha hai aisi political
parties  ka aur –
RaJVEER
Uncle aapka voh Ma Baap ke saath na
rehne wala point bahut amazing tha
-
PRASHANT MEHTA
Udo mat zyada! Samjhey!
(gestures at Ranjit)
Yeh toh Ranjit Ji hain... inka
haath hai - aam ladka jail mein sad
raha hota!
RAJVEER
Uncle main toh bas -
PRASHANT MEHTA
Tumhey pata hai tumney kya kiya
hai! Jao abhie! Aur aage dhyan
rakho  - agli baar judge lambi
sunayega! Samjhey! Aur case khatam
nahi  hua hai abhie!
The boys are zapped.
PRASHANT MEHTA (CONT'D)
(turns to Ranjit and
starts talking non-
chalantly again)
Ranjit Ji main keh raha hoon aapse
- UDF ki saari policies next to
absurd hain - Parliamentary
election   ke time mein resign karke
chunaav ladoonga aur logon ke liye
kaam karoonga...... Kuchh toh aisa
karein jissey dil ko sukoon mile -
bahut ho gayi vakalat.
The boys wander off insulted.
DISSOLVE TO:
67INS. INT. MINAL'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Minal's parents are watching a debate on TV. She is standing
in the kitchen watching tea boil.
ANCHOR
Haal filhaal ki kuchh ghatnaon -
jaise Surajkund case ki vajah se
samaaj mein aaj ek behas chhidi hui
hai - yeh behas azaadi ya personal
expression ke virudh khadi karti
hai acceptabilty ya samajik maap
dandon ko - Swamiji aapse pochhna
chahungi - baar baar auraton pe hi
chhote chhote pratibandh kyun?
SWAMI JI
(softly)
Kyunki shaleenta auraton ka hi
gehna hai!
AD GURU
(shouting)
What nonsense Swami Ji? What is
this - a mythological TV serial in
which we are living!
SOCIALITE
(shouting above his
voice)
Aise attitudes naturally
Patriachal societies mein kafi hadh
tak prevail kartey hain!
Minal looks lost as her mother comes in! Mother looks
worried. She takes her hands in her hands.
MOTHER
Minu tu ... tu ... tu kuchh aisa
vaisa mat karna...tu...
MINAL
Utni kamzor nahi hoon main Maam -
nahi toh baat yahan tak pahunchti?
She kind of smiles as she pats her mother's hands.
DISSOLVE TO:
67A. INT. COURT – DAY6 - DECEMBER
The Judge waves Deepak on.
JUDGE
Cross kar lijiye!
Deepak walks upto her.
DEEPAK
Miss Arora are you a virgin?
JUDGE
Is this relevant at all?
It is.
DEEPAK
(turns to Minal)
Are you willing to answer this?
JUDGE
Minal Arora - in that case hum yeh
session in camera kar saktey hain-
aap zyada comfortable raheingi!
MINAL
No your honour I will answer in
open court!
Everyone is zapped. We don't know what Deepak is getting at.
Even Prashant is confused for a bit.
DEEPAK
Are you a virgin Miss Arora?
Minal shakes her head in a NO.
DEEPAK (CONT'D)
Haan ya na mein clearly jawaab
dijiye!
Nahi!
MINAL
DEEPAK
At what age did you lose your
virginity?
JUDGE
How is this even relevant Mr.
Sehgal?
DEEPAK
Victim ka character baar baar
question na ho isliye main sab ek
baar  saaf saaf poochh hi leta hoon.
Prosecution ko koi objection?
Prashant is like this guy is doing my job. He shakes his
head in a NO.
DEEPAK (CONT'D)
Kab khoyi aapne apni virgnity?
MINAL
I was 19.
DEEPAK
19. So you were 19. 19. At the age
of 19 you lost your virginity. At
19. An adult. Yeh important hai
your honour. Who was the boy?
Beat.
MINAL
My boyfriend... Anish!
DEEPAK
Did he pay for it?
MINAL
Yeh kaisa sawaal hai, why would he
pay for it?
DEEPAK
Just answer me! Did he pay for it?
JUDGE
Where are we going with this?
DEEPAK
You promised to answer. I just want
an answer.
MINAL
Nahi hum ek doosre ko pasand kartey
thhey - we were attracted to each
other - so pay karney ka sawaal hi
kahan aata hai!
DEEPAK
Toh usne aapko pay nahi kiya - He
didn't pay you - did he force you?
MINAL
(getting pushed a bit
now)
Nahi usne force bhi nahi kiya - pay
bhi nahi kiya - we liked each other
- we did it because we both wanted
to.
DEEPAK
Iske baad, jaise ki aapko jaanne
wale uss ladke Vishwa ne police ko
bayan diya hai - aapke kayi
relationships hue. Kya aapke
lagbhag       sabke saath sexual
relations rahey?
MINAL
Haan kabhie kabhie magar-
DEEPAK
Toh hue and you've just admitted to
that. Toh phir uss din... ek
February  ko jab aap Rajvir ke saath
thein toh aisa kya ho gaya tha - I
mean ek aur se kya farq padhta tha?
MINAL
What? Kya matlab hai iss ka?
DEEPAK
Matlab yeh ki 1st february ki raat
ko Rajvir aur uske saathiyun ne bhi
yehi socha hoga na ki yeh ek fairly
promiscous ladki hai - ek aur se
kya      farq padega - I understand unki
itni maturity nahi hai ki voh yeh
soch sakein ki issey pehle aisa jab
bhi hua aapki marzi se!! Bina paise
liye - bina kisi dabaav ke hua -
But since you were a woman of
questionable character in the minds
of       the accused - Rajvir and his
friends - aapne kya clear
indication   diya iss ladke ko ki -
main     iss waqt sex mein interested
nahi hoon!
MINAL
Pehle maine mana kiya...
DEEPAK
Kya kaha ya kiya?
MINAL
Maine push kiya usko... resist kiya
- Bola don't do it...
DEEPAK
So mana kiya aapne...
MINAL
Yeah I said NO!
DEEPAK
WHAT?
MINAL
NO – I SAID NO
DEEPAK
Kya? Kya kaha aapne?
MINAL
NO. I said NO.
DEEPAK
No. She said NO your honour. No.
Uske bavajood Rajvir Singh ne inko
inappropriately chhuva - bahut
gande       tareekey se - she felt
humiliated - yeh thoda nashe mein
thin       - aur nashe se mujhe rule no 4
yaad aaya - kisi ladke ke saath
baithke aapko sharaab peena nahi
chahiye  - Kyunki unhey lagta hai ki
aisa karne wali ladki unhey khuli
chhot degi - that is she easy...
Excuse my choice of words but ladkon ko
lagta hai ki saath mein baith ke peeni
wali ladki saath mein sone se bhi nahi
katraayegi...
(just because you are seen drinking eith somebody doesnt mean that
she is easy)
Yahan peena health hazard nahi
kharaab character ki nishaani maana
jaata hai ladkiyun ke liye... lekin
ladkon pe yeh apply nahi hota. Unke
liye sirf health hazard. Terms and
conditions vary your honour.
(sarcastically)
Aur bhi rules hain - Rule no 5 -
jeans, t shirt, skirt etc etc
ladkiyun  ko bilkul nahi pehanna
chahiye kyunki issey inka toh kuchh
nahi bigadta lekin ladkon ko khatra
ho jaata hai - bechare ladkey issey
uttejit hoke, bina koi galti hotey
hue  bhi galti karkey phans saktey
hain. Rule no 6 - jaisa ki haal hi
mein kisi ne kaha hai - ladkiyun ko
har ladke ko Bhaiyya bulana chahiye
- Bhaiyya bulayengey toh ladkon ko
koi galatfahmi nahi hogi - ladke
safe raheingey - kuchh galat nahi
samjheingey - kuchh galat nahi
kareingey      - aaj tak hum galat
direction  mein effort kartey rahein
hain your honour - it is our boys
that we must keep safe not our
girls   - if we keep our boys safe,
the girls will automatically be
safe. Isliye Rule no - 7 - chowmein
ban kar dena chahiye - Ladkun ko
chowmein bilkul na khaane diya
jaaye,   yehi unse galti karvaata hai
aur agar bechare galti se kha bhi
lein - toh kisi chowmein khaane
wale ladke ke paas ladkiyan ko nahi
jaana chahiye - aur agar gayin toh
phir kanoon ki koi zimmedari nahi
honi chahiye - Rule no 8 - jo
accused Rajvir Singh ka hi suggest
kiya hua hai isliye yeh bahut
important rule hai - hans hans ke
baat   nahi karni hai kisi bhi ladke
se  - voh galat samajh sakta hai -
khushi ki baat bhi chehre pe
seriousness rakhtey hue batani
chahiye ladkiyun ko. Rule no 9 -
Koi  ladki shehar mein alag ya akele
nahi rahegi - aisa sirf ladke kar
saktey hain - ladkiyan independent
hoke ladkon ko confuse na karein -
Rule no 10 - 11 - 12 - ladkiyun ko
mobile mat dijiye, zyada mat
padhaiyye, jaldi shaadi kar dijiye
etc     etc etc. But I am digressing.
Meri client ne khali Rule no 4 toda
- thodi pi rakhi thi jiski sazza
hai nahi kanoon mein par aap de
saktey hain - Since she had a few
drinks perhaps that caused the
intensity of her action - and that
is     how it happened!Baar baar chhue
jaane pe ek ladki ki pratikriya thi
- self defence mein uthaya hua ek
kadam - causing grievous injury ya
attempt to murder nahi!
PRASHANT MEHTA
(feeling cornered,
realises what Deepak was
upto decides to go on the
offensive)
Yeh ‘TIPSY’ / nashi mein thein Sir
- but inhi ke according inki yeh
doosri saathi Falak Ali toh hosh
mein thein - Inhoney toh koi botal
nahi todi Vishwa ke sar pe  - aaram
se Andrea ki tarah ek ladke ke
saath nikal gayi - Jiski footage
aapne dekhi hai - Therefore I would
like to again call Falak Ali on the
stand!
67B. INT. COURTROOM. DAY6
An awkward Falak takes the stand as the Judge waves her on.
She is terrified because of the lines on which questioning
has been happening and also because her mother and brother
are in court today.
As Prashant starts questioning her, she is already uneasy!
PRASHANT MEHTA (CONT'D)
Aap Professor Javed Sheikh ko
jaantin hain?
FALAK
Ji!
PRASHANT MEHTA
(smiles)
Kaise?
FALAK
Dost hain mere?
PRASHANT MEHTA
Dost? Ya dost se zyada!
FALAK
Voh mera personal matter hai!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Aapke yeh dost aapse thode bade bhi
hain age mein - divorced hain aur
ek   -
FALAK
Voh unka personal matter hai!
DEEPAK
Objection!
JUDGE
Prashant Ji... Sustained.
PRASHANT MEHTA
Unka inse koi personal relation
nahi hai main yeh prove karoonga
your honour. It is a purely
business relationship. Vo inke
client hain. Inka yeh bank
statement submitted hai your
honour.   Isse inka exact nature of
relationship prove hota hai!
FALAK
(shaking her head)
Aap... aap... kya - aise kaise keh
saktey hain aap ek ladki -
PRASHANT MEHTA
Yeh aapke account mein unke account
se over the years itne saare bank
transfers hain -
FALAK
Loans liye hain - mere bhai ka
treatment chal raha hai - he is a
special child and he also has
leukemia   - Chemotherapy vagairah
mein bahut kharcha hota raha,
isliye liye hain - aur maine abhie
lautana shuru bhi kiya hai - unn
transactions ke baaarey mein kyun
nahi   bataya aapne sab ko?
PRASHANT MEHTA
Vohi batane wala tha ki suddenly ab
inhoney unko thode thode paise
lautaney shuru kiye hain - case
file    hone ke baad se ... kahin na
kahin inhe maalooom tha yeh baat
court ke saamne laayi jaayegi -
after all yeh ek professional hain
aur...
FALAK
Har baat ko tod marod ke pesh kyun
kartey hain aap - breakup hua
hamara     - isliye ab main comfortable
nahi hoon aur paise lauta rahi
hoon!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Inko paise ki zarurat hamesha rehti
hai - aur aise hi yeh apni income
supplement kartin hain - Andrea ke
jaane    ke baad aap kamrey se bahar
isliye gayin!
DEEPAK
Objection!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Kamaal hai ek ek karke yeh ladkiyan
ja rahin hain ek ek ladke ke -
DEEPAK
Objection!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Yeh inke medical bills submit kiye
gaye hain - loans aur inki income
se...
DEEPAK
Objection!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Possible hi nahi hai bina kisi side
income...
DEEPAK
Objection!
FALAK
Meri friends bhi paise...
PRASHANT MEHTA
Aapki income ka yehi source hai -
aap paise aise hein kamaatin
hain... nahi toh nahi jaatin aap -
She starts getting teary eyed.
FALAK
Nahi jaana chahiye tha mujhe - uss
waqt se abtak - regret kar rahi
hoon yeh baat main - main nahi
jaati toh shayad yeh sab nahi hota
- ya phir jo hota donon ke saath -
Seeins this her brother starts to get angry and howl in
court. Falak's mother takes him out.
PRASHANT MEHTA
Aap vajah bataiyye - galti toh main
jaanta hoon apki! Aapne paise -
DEEPAK
Objection!
FALAK
Aapne Minal ke saath jo kiya vohi
aap mere saath -
PRASHANT MEHTA
Please answer the question! Apne
paise-
FALAK
Yeh repeated humiliation kisliye?
Yehi prove karney ke liye na ki
humney inse paise maange hain?
PRASHANT ADVANI
Bilkul maange hain paise aapne -
DEEPAK
Your honour I -
PRASHANT ADVANI
Inhoney agar paise nahi maane hotey
toh -
FALAK
Haan theek hai maange humne paise -
DEEPAK
(gets up as he realises
what is happening)
Your honour mujhe ek minute apne
client-
FALAK
(to Deepak)
Nahi I want to admit - yes we took
the money! Maange paise... Liye
bhi! Phir!
Everybody is in shock. Prashant seems a bit relieved.
Minal and Andrea look shocked.
ANDREA
Why are you doing this? Why are you
branding us like that? Minal!
Minal is uanble to speak.
FALAK
I know what I am doing Andrea.
JUDGE
One of the girls has admitted to
the charge under PITA! Falak Ali!
Deepak gets up.
FALAK
Aap baithiye Sir.
(to the Judge)
Lekin Sir paise leke Minal ka man
badal gaya - she withdrew her
consent   - usne NA bola - clearly na
bola  - even then this man touched
her  - voh sahi thi - Rajvir galat
tha - she withdrew her consent - NA
bola usne! Uske baad bhi usney ise
chhua. Aap bataiyye By law voh sahi
thi ya yeh?
The judge looks at Falak.
Music fades in.
A lady constable is looking at Falak. Then she looks at
Deepak catching his eye.
CUT TO:
68. INT. SARVAPRIYA VIHAR HOUSE KAROL BAGH HOUSE -
DAY(ALREADY SHOT)
Andrea is sitting in a corner crying her heart out.
Falak is sitting stoic.
The door bell rings.
She walks towards the door and opens it. Minal is standing
there with her luggage.
As Minal slaps and then hugs Falak, Falak now really starts
to howl and cries her heart out.
CUT TO:
69A / 69B. INT. RAJVEER'S HOUSE - EVE
Everyone is glum. Ranjit calls Prashant
69B. INT. EXT. COURTROOM. EVE
RANJIT
Kya naya drama tha yeh Prashant Ji?
PRASHANT MEHTA
It was a surprise, uss ladki ne
achanak -
RANJIT
Kuchh kijiye Prashant Ji - thoda
hil gaya hoon main!
CUT TO:
70. INT. DEEPAK'S HOUSE - NIGHT (ALREADY SHOT)
Falak brings Deepak some coffee. Deepak is angry with Falak
her.
DEEPAK
It could have all gone wrong.
FALAK
Mere baad wapis Andrea ko bulatey -
pata nahi kya kya kehtey - tang aa
gayi thi!
Deepak nods and takes a sip of the coffee. He likes it.
DEEPAK
Stick to coffee. Chai bahut kharab
banati ho tum!
FALAK
I know - aap pehle aadmi hain jisne
yeh sach bola!
DEEPAK
Aajkal mere jaise hi sach boltey
hain!
She laughs. He laughs. They laugh loudly. A moment.
CUT TO:
71. INT. JUDGE'S CHAMBER – DAY7 – JANUARY 2017
The Judge is sitting with Deepak and Prashant in his
chamber. They are sipping tea.
JUDGE
Beat.
Please do not misconstrue this...
Court mein jo hoga voh
professionally aur ethically hi
hoga         lekin yahan... as old
colleagues... kuchh baatein off
record        toh kar saktey hain... This
Falak Ali confession - ab record pe
aa toh gaya Prashant Ji - but it is
clear that...
(shrugs)
She was simply trying to make a
point.!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Confession wapis liya ja sakta
hai... uske alaava main aur court
ki madad nahi kar sakta.
JUDGE
Nahi I am not interested in
technicalities aur main aisa advice
bhi       nahi kar raha. But I hope you
guys realise this is an important
one. Isliye baat karna chahta tha!
One has to be sensitive - galat
nahi hona chahiye kuchh!
PRASHANT ADVANI
I am sorry but - pehle bhi
sensitive aur important cases hue
hain     - aur maine aur Mr. Sehgal ne
ladey hain!
JUDGE
Oh C'mmon Prashant Ji - we are not
in open court. Deepak Ji -
I hope you realise - witnesses -
evidence - kafi kuchh hai ladkiyun
ke khilaaf hai!
Deepak doesn't answer.
DEEPAK
(softly)
Lekin iss baar nahi... main koi
case nahi ladh raha... main koi
technicality ya loophole bhi nahi
dhoondh raha... sahi behas honi
chahiye   - faisla chahe kuchh bhi ho
- mujhe aaj ke aaj justice nahi
chahiye - main kal tak rukne ko bhi
taiyyar hoon.
Beat.
Beat.
PRASHANT ADVANI
Vakalat mera profession hai aur
apne clients ko achhi tarah defend
karna mera kaam... Toh main inhi
witnesses aur evidence ke basis pe
apne clients ko poori competence se
defend karoonga!
JUDGE
Let's go to court then.
CUT TO:
72. INT. COURTROOM – DAY7
Pin drop silence in court. Deepak is examining Rajvir. His
family is also present.
DEEPAK
Aapke hisaab se jab bhi koi ladki
hans hans ke, touch kartey hue kisi
ladke se baat karey toh voh hint de
rahi hai ki aaiyye mere saath so
jaiyye!
RAJVEER
Maine aisa nahi kaha!
DEEPAK
Aapka bayan hai yeh!
RAJVEER
Nahi maine iss case mein kaha
tha... baqi depend karta hai!
DEEPAK
Kispe?
RAJVEER
Matlab kahan kaise mile -
DEEPAK
Matlab rock show mein mile toh hint
hai - library ya mandir mein mile
toh hint nahi hai! Venue dekhke bhi
character decide kartey hain aap -
yeh    toh critical rule no 13 ho
gaya!
RAJVEER
Ab aap bekaar ki baatein kar rahein
hain!
DEEPAK
Bayan hai aapka - usko samajh raha
hoon! Anyway, Prashant Ji ne bataya
Minal ne pi rakhi thi. Aap nahi pi
rahey thhey?
RAJVEER
Pi raha tha!
DEEPAK
Aap nashey mein thhey - voh mana
kar rahi thi - aapne zabardasti ki
- usney aapko maara - yeh bhi toh
ho sakta hai!
RAJVIR
Lekin aisa hua nahi!
DEEPAK
Vaise aapko bahut bahut badhayi ho
aapki shaadi ho rahi hai.
He doesn't say anything. He just makes a weak getsure as in
Yeah.
DEEPAK (CONT'D)
MLA Janki Rani ki beti se aapki
shaadi ho rahi?
RAJVEER
Inn sab personal baaton ka case se
kya lena dena hai?
DEEPAK
Lena dena toh vaise meri client ki
personal baaton ka bhi nahi tha!
RAJVEER
Toh uski tarah mera bhi character
nahi hai yeh prove karna chahtey
hain aap?
DEEPAK
Nahi usey prove karne ki zaroorat
kahan hai!
Laughter in the court. Rajveer feels humiliated.
RAJVEER
Kya?
DEEPAK
Aap itna kyun react kar rahein
hain! Main toh bas aapko shaadi pe
wish kar raha hoon! Aapko gussa aa
raha hai!
RAJVEER
Nahi gussa nahi ho raha hoon main
lekin inn sab personal baaton ka
matlab?
DEEPAK
Aapko aksar gussa aata hai jab koi
vaisi baat karta hai jo aap sunna
pasand nahi kartey?
RAJVEER
Nahi aisi koi baat nahi hai! Baar
baar yeh baat kyun kar rahe ho tum?
DEEPAK
Tum... kamaal hai - main itni izzat
se baat kar raha hoon aap se aur
aap... anyway 'tumse' yehi expected
hai! Aap regulary prostitutes ke
paas jaatey hain?
RAJVEER
Nahi!
DEEPAK
Achha! Toh yeh first time tha agar
hum yeh maan lein ki meri clients -
RAJVEER
Ji mera first time tha -
DEEPAK
Aapne randomly jis ladki ko aap
jaantey bhi nahi, dinner pe kyun
bulaya?
RAJVEER
They said they were hungry and...
DEEPAK
Aap Hindi mein bol saktey hain...
humney suna hai aapko boltey hue!
RAJVIR
Unhoney kaha humey bhookh lagi hai
- bula liya - insaaniyat dikha di -
vohi galti ki - humey kya pata tha
yeh kaisi ladkiyan hain!
DEEPAK
Sharaab bhi insaaniyat dikhane ke
naate offer ki!
RAJVIR
Usne khud drink banayi! Photo dekhi
na!
Andrea ki toh photo nahi hai -
unhey aapne drink kyun offer ki?
RAJVIR
Hum pi rahey thhey - aise hi poochh
liya hoga!
DEEPAK
Aapki itne reputable logon ke yahan
shaadi fix hui hai - phir bhi aapko
yeh admit karney se ya shaadi
tootne se koi dar nahi lag raha hai
- ki aap randomly pretty ladkiyun
ko dekhke insaaniyat dikahtey hain
- with dinner and drinks.
Rajvir looks around at his family, in laws etc. He feels
further cornered.
DEEPAK (CONT'D)
Should I tell the court why? Kyunki
sexual assault ke liye aap lamba
andar jaatey isliye aapne yeh poori
kahani gadhi hai ki meri...
PRASHANT ADVANI
Objection your honour. Inki clients
ne admit kiya hai - uske baad kaha
ki consent withdraw kiya - ab aap
us theory pe rahiye ki prostitutes
hain - nahi hain ka ab kya matlab
hai?
DEEPAK
Let me ask you another question -
ab jab Minal ne wahan khud peg
banake sharaab peena shuru kiya toh
aapko immediately yeh nahi laga ki
yeh kharab ladkiyan hain? Aap uth
ke chale kyun nahi gaye?
RAJVIR
(hesitates)
Aaah...
(looks at Prashant who
shakes his head in a NO)
Nahi hamey aisa nahi laga!
DEEPAK
Aapke ghar mein bhi koi ladki
sharab peeti hai?
RAJVEER
(angry)
Nahi! Sirf gents peetey hain -
Aapki ma ya behan nahi peetin?
RAJVEER
(angrier)
Achhe ghar ki auratein nahi peetin!
Hamarey yahan bhi nahin!
DEEPAK
Parties mein jaatin hain?
RAJVEER
Family gatherings mein jaatin hain!
DEEPAK
Isliye party mein aane wali har
ladki, khaaskar jo drink karey -
uspe  aap apna pushtaini haque
samajhtey hain. Meri clients ke
baar     mein aapne yehi raay banayi...
aapke yahan ki achhi ladkiyan nahi
peetin, yeh peetin hain isliye buri
hai aur iske saath kuchh bhi kiya
ja sakta hai. Isliye main aapko ek
tasveer dikhaunga jismein aapki
sister drink kar rahin hain aur -
RAJVEER

Aukat mein reh, gaad dunga yahin -
tujhe pata nahi tu kisse baat...
All overlapping constantly.
PRASHANT ADVANI
Yeh kya line of questioning hai?
Unneccessarily kyun mere client ko
provoke   kiya ja raha hai!
Rajveer grabs the picture and tears it.
RAJVEER
(angry)
Yeh galat hai. Meri behan inke
jaisi nahi hai. Khulke peena - kisi
ke bhi saath chale jaana - inke
jaisi ladkiyan kartin hain shareef
ladkiyan nahi - aisi ladkiyun ke
saath  aisa hi hota hai!
PRASHANT ADVANI
Please keep quiet aapko -
DEEPAK
Hota nahi hai na hona chahiye lekin
tum jaise log apna haque samajh ke
kartey hain. Inke kapde ya inka
peena tumko koi haque nahi deta ki

PRASHANT ADVANI
Objection!
RAJVEER
(almost laughing at
Deepak as if Deepak is
crazy)
Aaram se saath chal de - saath mein
baith ke piye - koi bhi normal
aadmi samjhega hi na ki taiyaar lag
rahi hain - nahi toh kyun aayengi -
kyun piyengi -
PRASHANT ADVANI
Objection!
DEEPAK
Nahi agar ladki ko yeh pata chal
jaaye ki aisa karney pe aap uska
balatkaar karney ki koshish
kareingey  toh voh nahi piyegi -
PRASHANT ADVANI
Rajvir Stop!
RAJVEER
(crazed out)
Kaise nahi karega koi kuchh - aisi
ladkiyun ko dekhke mann karta hai -
mujhse nahi kisi se bhi poochh lo -
voh inhey vohi samjheingey -
RAAND!!!
DEEPAK
Thank you. So this is exactly what
happened your honour. Aajkal ki
ladkiyan hain toh ladkiyan hi. Voh
kisi   ke saath dinner karney ko ya
drink karney ko choice samjhtin
hain, available hone ka signboard
nahi. Lekin aise well dressed, well
educated ladke abhie bhi usi feudal
mentality ke shikaar hain aur inn
chhoti chhoti baaton se decide kar
letey hain ki kaunsi achhi ladki
hai  aur kiske saath liberty li ja
sakti hai! Aur aise mein uski NA
inko  NA nahi HAAN sunayi deti hai.
I rest my case.
The Judge looks at Rajvir and then at Minal. He seems to be
switching sides.

JUDGE
(looks up from the document)
340, 503, 506 ka matter sun rahein hain aaj?
DEEPAK SEHGAL
(lost)
Yes your honour! Main Ankit Malhotra ko bulaana
chahunga!
Ankit Malhotra is asked to and takes the stand.
DEEPAK
You honour please take a look at Exhibit PW 1/1 in this
case - Mozar Mobile ke engineer ki report hai jissey
prove hota hai ki Ankit Malhotra, Raunak Anand aur
Minal Arora ek hi time pe ek hi moving vehicle mein
present thhey!
ANKIT
Haan Sir thhey lekin bas compromise ki baat kar rahey
thhey! Falak ne Vishwa ko bola tha ki Green Park aa jao
Minal se milney ke liye. Tabhie toh maine SMS bhi
bhejha  tha - “Coming to pick you up in Five!”
PRASHANT MEHTA
(getting up)
Humney record ke liye submit kiya hua hai Sir!
DEEPAK
Compromise ki baat karney ke liye tees kilometer
ghoomney ki kya zarurat thi?
ANKIT
Sir voh gaadi mein thi lekin bandh nahi thi - voh khud
aayi thi... compromise ki baat kar rahi thi ki paise
dogey toh main case wapis le loongi - Sir agar hum usey
molest kar rahey hotey toh kya uski body pe koi nishaan
nahi hotey aur kya hum usey ghar drop kartey - humey
blackmail kar rahin hain yeh ladkiyan Sir! Yeh hamesha
kahti rahin hain ki court ladkiyun ki baat sunta hai -
paise do nahi toh sadogey jail mein! Isi liye maine
Falak  ka call record karne ke liye kaha tha Vishwa ko!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Iske liye Falak Ali ki recording jo humney submit ki
hai - court sun le toh behtar rahega!
The judge nods the court clerk plays the recording of
Falak saying - “ Jail mein sadogey” etc.
DEEPAK
Yeh ek edited recording hai your honour!
PRASHANT MEHTA
I am sorry lekin kya aap ke paas ek bhi record - ek bhi
evidence - ek bhi witness hai jo kehta hai ki Minal
Arora     ko ek vehicle mein illegally confine karkey unhey
molest kiya gaya?
Beat. We think Deepak has nothing.
DEEPAK
You honour yeh CCTV grab hai jab yeh gaadi ek bridge ke
oopar chadh rahi thi - aap clearly ismein dekh saktey
hain ki meri client ko inhoney pakad ke rakha hua hai!
(we don’t know if he is thinking of )
Minal when he is saying this)
She was in great pain! Great pain!
PRASHANT MEHTA
Your honour iske baarey mein humey pehle inform nahi
kiya gaya hai. We would need time to answer this!
JUDGE
The court will grant you that!
DEEPAK
I would like to examine Defence Wintess No. 1

DEEPAK
Perjury ki sazza kya hai aapko pata hai?
PRASHANT MEHTA
Objection. Defence meri witness ko intimidate kar raha

DEEPAK
Warn kar raha hoon Prashant Ji.
Vishwa swallows some spit.
DEEPAK
Falak ne tumhey compromise ke liye call kiya tha?
VISHWA
Haan!
DEEPAK
Jhooth. 17th March ko pehla call tumne kiya tha Falak
ko! This is on record.
VISHWA
Ji!
DEEPAK
Uske baad 18th March ko usne tumhey call kiya.
VISHWA
Sir voh -
DEEPAK
Jis restaurant mein tum ussey mile wahan hamarey paas
witnesses hain!
VISHWA
Nahi voh main ... actually...
He wipes sweat.
DEEPAK
I can prove this and I can prove that you are guilty of
perjury! Bade log toh kabhie kabhie bach bhi jaate
hain... Lekin tum...
VISHWA
Sir... Sir... Main...I am... Sir main I am not sure...
DEEPAK

JUDGE
Closing Arguments for all the cases
please!
Prashant Mehta gets up.
PRASHANT MEHTA
Maine court ke saamne prove kiya
hai your honour ki yeh teenon
ladkiyan wahan prostitution ke
intent     se gayin aur incident ke
baad bhaag gayin. Aur itne din tak
chup rahin... agar galti nahi hoti
toh incident ke itne din baad tak
yeh police se bhaagtin nahi balki
khud chalke police ke paas jaatin.
Jo ki mere client ne kiya. Agar
uske dil mein chor hota toh voh
khud inke against FIR karke baat
kyun khulvaata? After all Rajvir
Singh ek reputable family se hai -
young hai - uske saamne uska poora
future hai - Maine aapke saamne
doctor  ki report pesh ki jismein
saaf kaha gaya hai ki humla jaan
leva tha. Investigative officer ne
bhi saaf kaha hai ki ladkiyun ke
bayan mein koi dum nahi hai. Waiter
aur Manager ne inke khilaaf witness
di. Circumstantial video evidence
saunpi gayi court ko. Attack mein
jo weapon use hua voh bhi barmad
hua, uspe Minal Arora ke ungliyun
ke nishaan hain aur doosre case
mein aapke paas Falak Ali ka
admission hai. usne na bola kisi ne
suna nahi - na hum maujood di -
Consent ka koi issue hi involved
nahi   tha - yeh toh sirf defence ka
ek hathkanda hai kyunki aajkal
consent debate ki thodi hawa hai,
inhoney court mein bina basis ke
vohi debate utaar di. Inke pehle
Beat.
case ki tarah hi inke doosra cases
bhi farzi hain, isliye usmein
phansaye hue sabhie innocent ladkun
ko baizzat bari kiya jaaye. Attempt
to murder ke under main Minal Arora
ke liye kum se kum dus saal ki
sazza ki demand karta hoon aur baqi
donon ladkiyun ko sabak sikhaney ke
liye unhey khaali fine karke na
chhoda jaaye - unko bhi chhey
mahine    ki saza sunayi jaaye taki
voh  aage aisi harkatun se baaz
aayein! That is all!
JUDGE
Deepak Ji any closing arguement?
76B. INT. COURTROOM. DAY9
DEEPAK
(gets up)
No.
Everybody reacts. The judge lightly uses the hammer to
silence the crowd.
But he does not sit. It is quiet in the court now.
DEEPAK (CONT'D)
Aur Na sirf ek shabd nahi, apne aap
mein ek poora vakya hai. Isey kisi
tarah ke tark, spashtikaran ya
vyakhya ki zaroorat nahi hoti aur
na     ka matlab na hi hota hai. She
said NO. She clearly said NO and we
must make that NO count, make that
NO echo - so that boys like him
realise that NO means NO... chahe
voh bolne wali ladki aapki koi
parichit ho, friend ho, girlfriend
ho,   koi prostitute ho ya aapki apni
biwi.
(pained, angered, almost
frustrated)
Yes. No means No and it is time to
stop when somebody says so.
The Judge looks long and hard at Deepak.
We can see the Judge has now completely moved onto the
girl's side.
The Judge looks at Minal who has mildly not hugged but kind
of clutched onto Deepak's shirt who is still standing.
JUMP CUT TO:
76C. INT. COURTROOM. DAY9
The courtroom has split into groups around Deepak and
Prashant's side.
All anxious on various sides.
They are all looking at their watches.
Minal shuffles at the back.
The judge enters. They all become quiet. The judge settles.
They all wait with bated breath. As the judge adjusts his
specs to read, he looks briefly at Minal. We hold onto
Minal.
JUMP CUT TO:
76D. INT. COURTROOM. DAY 9
People start filing out of the court as Prashant leaves
stoic.
JUMP CUT TO:

76G. INT. COURTROOM. DAY
Only Deepak is left.
JUMP CUT TO:
JUDGE (V.O.)
The court believes that a beginning has been made in this
case. Although Minal Arora ke khilaaf 307 ke case mein gawah bhi
thhey aur evidence bhi - voh court ke saamne un circumstances ko clear
kar paayin jinki vajah se yeh haadsa hua - The court finds that
there was grave provocation aur unke khilaaf 307 ke under jo charge
tha usko dismiss karti hai. Section 320, 324 ke under Minal Arora,
Falak Ali aur Andrea Taraing ke khilaaf jo bhi charges hain voh
nature mein motivated aur vindictive paaye gaye hain. Ismein
unke khilaaf koi solid evidence nahi hai. The court finds Rajvir
Singh guilty under section 354 of outraging a woman’s modesty, Ankit
Malhotra and Dumpy Anand under 340 and the IT act and Ankit Malhotra
under 503 and 506. The court has decided to let Vishwajyoti Ghosh
off with a warning. The court will set a further date for sentencing
and announce the quantum of the sentence.
OLD -
Aaj tak hamney ladkiyun ko
acceptable behaviour kya hai iske
baarey mein bahut kuchh bataya hai
- Isliye apne ladkon ko aceeptable
behaviour ke baarey mein hum shayad
batana bhool gaye hain. The court
finds Rajvir Singh, Vishwajyoti
Ghosh, Ankit Malhotra and Dumpy
Anand guilty in the various cases
filed against them.  Minal Arora,
Falak Ali aur Andrea Taraing ke
khilaaf jo bhi charges hain voh
nature mein motivated aur
vindictive paaye gaye hain. The
court     will set a further date for
sentencing and announce the quantum
of     the sentence.

RAJVEER

Rajveer goes to get a drink.
Andrea just turns back and looks at the girls.
They step out with herinto the corridor.
ANDREA
Let us get out of here now.
FALAK
Haan chal chal!
MINAL
Bata toh dein!
They come in.
MINAL (CONT'D)
Achha guys ab hum chaltey hain!
FALAK

RAJVEER

Arey we will drop you - bas ek
drink peeke chaltey hain - please
please baitho na!
He forces a drink into Minal's hands.
ANDREA
I need to use the loo.
She starts to leave. Rajvir winks at Dumpy.
RAJVEER
Dumpy apna room khol de na Andrea
ke liye! Iska flush kaam nahi kar
raha - it is dirty - leke ja na!
They are seen together outside Dumpy's room and going in.
JUMP CUT TO:
Andrea comes out of the loo to see it is dark. She is
scared.
Boo!

ANDREA
Oh God Dumpy!
DUMPY
I scared you. Didnt I?
FALAK

Kahan reh gayi yaar Andrea?
RAJVIR
Haan dekh ke aa Vishwa!
JUMP CUT TO:
Vishwa follows Falak. They are seen in the corridor.
Inside Rajveer is a bit tipsy. He plants a kiss on Minal's
cheek.
He laughs.
MINAL
You are drunk Rajvir.
Rajvir starts to bolt the door but Minal stops him.
MINAL (CONT'D)
What are you doing?
Rajveer grabs her.
RAJVEER
Come no.
MINAL
Hey - you are high. Take it easy
dude!
RAJVEER
(grabs her hard)
Nakhrey mat kar na itna.
Minal just turns and breaks the bottle she is holding in her
hand over his head.
There is total silence for a while.
Then Rajveer shrieks as we see a shard of glass stuck in his
left eye and his head also hurt. He howls in pain. Blood
begins to pour. Everybody else rushes in and sees this.
