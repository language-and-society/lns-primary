1      EXT. SCHOOL BELL AREA - DELHI – DAY                        1
Students are quietly studying in classes as teachers drone
on. The central courtyard looks deserted barring four senior
girls lurking under the big old school bell. They are
KALINDI, MEERA, SAKSHI and AVNI. Kalindi is holding the rope
that rings the bell.
KALINDI
Kitne.. khassi ho tum
log..pakkado!!
AVNI
Nahi bilkul nahi..I don’t want to
lose my badge.
She is wearing a Head Girl’s badge and is clearly
uncomfortable.
MEERA
Agar pakde gaye na Bade papa ne
class leni hai.
SAKSHI
Avni last day hai school ka..kal se
tu itni important nahi. chal..
MEERA
Wahe guru!
GIRLS(CHORUS)
One,two,three.. Bhaago Bhagooo
Grabs the rope. They turn to Avni.  She nervously looks
around before succumbing and extending her hand.
The girls literally hang of the huge bell in an attempt to
ring it as loudly as possible. Gong. Gong. Gong. Confused
students and teachers rush out of class. The girls make a run
for   it laughing. Peon comes to look who did this..
PEON
Chalo class mein. Class khatam nahi
hua ha.. Chalo apni classes mein..

The girls are lounging around. They are still in their
uniforms that have messages scribbled on them.
Meera has “Mother Dairy” written on her’s which she scribbles
over.
SAKSHI is on the bed with MEERA AND a teddy bear on her lap .
BOTH WATCHING AVNI giggling on the phone.
AVNI
No I love you more..no..no I love
you more.
Kalindi finds a brand new flowery girly looking dress hanging
on the cupboard.
KALINDI
Shiii!!! kitni gandi dress hai isko
main party mein pehen ke nahi ja
sakti .. mumma!
4      INT. KALINDI’S HOUSE - KALINDI’S ROOM - DAY                4
Meera gives Kalindi a concerned look. Kalindi just shrugs.
Avni is still on the phone.
AVNI
No I love more , No you hang up..no
you..
Sakshi takes the phone and hangs up. Avni looks at her in
disbelief. Meera and Kalindi giggle.
AVNI (CONT’D)
Sakshi what the fuck yaar..?
MEERA
Hadh hai yaar..Arjun ke peeche
peeche Poona toh tu jaa hi rahi

We hear a door slam in the background followed by incoherent
yelling by Kalindi’s Mom.
Knock. Mom, Dad and Chacha enter carrying a cake, Champagne
bottle, flutes and a camera.
KALINDI’S MOM

Dad puts down champagne tray on bed and kisses Kalindi.
Kalindi’s Mom kisses Kalindi’s forehead. You feel the
closeness between the mother and daughter as they hug
tightly.      Mom has 4 charm bracelets which she excitedly starts
putting on each of them.
COOKIE CHACHA
What’s up girls?

Group hug. Chacha clicks a picture as Mom and Dad awkwardly

MOM VOICE OVER
Parents bacho see hamesha apni
galatiyan chupate hain, well at
least      we try. Hum darte hain ki woh
hamre wali galatiyan na ker de, aur
usi chaker mein hum unhein unki
wali galatiyan bhi nahi kerne dete.
Ab meri beti ne yeh toh dekh liya
hai ki life koi fairy tale nahin,
per sapne dekhna zaroori hai. I
think zindagi mein khoob galatiyan
kerni chahiye aur unki sazaa bhi
pani chahiye..mager apni kisi aur
ki nahin.
Kalindi Walks back to the room.
AVNI
(sheepishly)
Achaa guys aaj na main farewell ke

Four hands raise a toast.

Rishab leaves Kalindi’s hand and walks to his family.
Rishab’s Mom attacks him with kisses as he meets the rest of
them with a peri-pona. Mom makes Rishab touch Panditji’s feet
against his wishes.
Kalindi stands there realizing that while he is her whole
world, she is only a fragment of his. She steadies herself
and gets ready to meet them.
RISHAB’S MOM

Mom sees Kalindi smiling at the back and gives her a big hug.
Santosh Aunty brings a velvet case and Rishab’s Mom pulls out
a thick gold chain with a big ass locket. Kalindi doesn’t
know how to react. She takes a step back. Mom follows
reaching out for her neck. Kalindi takes another step back.
Mom follows with grim determination.
RISHAB’S MOM
Aajao beta..
